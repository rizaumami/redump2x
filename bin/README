XISOs.

modernized by the XboxDev organization.

License is custom but similar to GPL, so I guess can redistribute the binary too.
The binaries included are my 32 bit linux build as 64 build create problematic
xiso (https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso/issues/29).

xbfuse

xbfuse is a utility to mount Xbox and Xbox 360 disk images via FUSE.
xbfuse used in redump2x so it will easily access game's default.xbe.

TODO: extract default.xbe or game.xbe directly from xiso.

The license is GPL Version 2, so I guess can redistribute my personal build
with this repo.
