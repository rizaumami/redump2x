attach.xbe
==========
This attacher is taken from https://github.com/Team-Resurgent/Repackinator.
Unlike the attacher by rmenhal, this attach.xbe not only capable to attach disc
image but also capable to attach drive and memory card image.
If combined with NKPatcher or Cerbios this utility will enabled us to boot XISOs
directly from ogxbox's disk.

extract-xiso
============
A command line utility to allow the creation, modification, and extraction of
XISOs.
Originally witten by in (in@fishtank.com), and currently maintained and
modernized by the XboxDev organization.
Link: https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso
License is custom but similar to GPL, so I guess can redistribute the binary too.
The binaries included are my personal build; (1) extract-xiso is 32 bit, and (2)
extract-xiso_x64 is 64 bit build.
See https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso/issues/29 as to why the need for two
binaries (for short, 64 build create problematic xiso).
