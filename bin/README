==========
This is Virtual disc attacher by rmenhal.
If combined with NKPatcher or Cerbios this utility will enabled us to boot XISOs
directly from ogxbox's disk.
MD5SUM: e658735e0a533d2a9f5dfb60b8334fc7  
Taken from driveimageutils-v1.0.1 package.
The license is GPL, so I guess can redistribute the binary with this repo.
Get it from the usual place.

extract-xiso
============
A command line utility to allow the creation, modification, and extraction of
XISOs. 
Originally witten by in (in@fishtank.com), and currently maintained and 
modernized by the XboxDev organization.
Link: https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso
License is custom but similar to GPL, so I guess can redistribute the binary too.
The binaries included are my personal build; (1) extract-xiso is 32 bit, and (2)
extract-xiso_x64 is 64 bit build.
See https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso/issues/29 as to why the need for two
binaries (for short, 64 build create problematic xiso).
