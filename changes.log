v0.8  - 20230219
- Update README.
- Fix missing xxd as dependency.
- Simpler patch's offset shift.

v0.7  - 20230218
Bugs fix:
- Failed to create Icon.jpg if there are two artworks exist for an ID.
  Now it will randomly select one of thos artwork as the Icon.jpg.
- Game's certificate patched on wrong offset.
- find search for default/game.xbe recursively resulted in incorrect xiso's
  folder stucture. Now it will only searchj in root dir.

v0.6  - 20230216 20:41:58
- Copy default.xbe's certicate to attach.xbe. Now:
  - trainers work
  - folder and file name taken from game's title
- To copy certificate, we need to acces default/game.xbe. Unfortunately, I'm
  not yet able to directly extract default.xbe from xiso.
  Hence a new dependency; xbfuse. xbfuse used to mount xiso so we can easy acces
  to its contents.
  TODO: extract default/game.xbe directly from xiso.
- Game cover for UnleashX dashboard using Rocky5's Xbox Artwork Installer.

v0.5  - 20230211 06:15:59
- Remove split and use dd to slice big image. Less dependency is better.
- Fix: No password asked when password is not pass to the arguments.
- Lower big image threshold to 4294967296 - 1024 just to be safe not hitting
  FATX's maximum file size.

v0.4  - 20221211 13:10:34
- Revert attach.xbe to driveimageutils's version.
  Some images failed to boot from Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Add archive (7z, and its supported archives) support.
  Most of the redump images distributed in zip or 7z archives.
- Update README.md.
- Move media patching option from -p to -m.
  To make it similar to extract-xiso's option.

v0.3  - 20221018 21:45:28
- Add dd extraction method.
  dd produce bigger image as it's only remove (the small) video partition, but
  still a nice option to have in case extract-xiso method failed to create
  working image.
- Replace driveimageutils's attach.xbe with Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Adding documentations.

v0.2  - 20220907 01:07:09
Probably a better script.

v0.1  - 20220903 19:39:50
- Initial commit.
- Basic operations such as extracting and xiso boot mostly works.
