- Remove split and use dd to slice big image. Less dependency is better.
- Fix: No password asked when password is not pass to the arguments.
- Lower big image threshold to 4294967296 - 1024 just to be safe not hitting
  FATX's maximum file size.

- Revert attach.xbe to driveimageutils's version.
  Some images failed to boot from Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Add archive (7z, and its supported archives) support.
  Most of the redump images distributed in zip or 7z archives.
- Update README.md.
- Move media patching option from -p to -m.
  To make it similar to extract-xiso's option.

v0.3  - 20221018 21:45:28
- Add dd extraction method.
  dd produce bigger image as it's only remove (the small) video partition, but
  still a nice option to have in case extract-xiso method failed to create
  working image.
- Replace driveimageutils's attach.xbe with Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Adding documentations.
