v1.3.1 - 20231203
- New xdvdfs build that fix https://github.com/antangelo/xdvdfs/issues/64
- Fix Metal Slug entry in TITLENAME array
- Fix build xdvdfs documentation
- Fix missing TMPDIR

v1.3 - 20231118
- Replace extract-xiso with xdvdfs.
- Remove xbfuse as we now (with info provided by xdvdfs) can directly extract
  default.xbe from a redump.iso.
- Use array to get Title Name by Title ID.
- Use this title name to naming xbe title, filename, and game's directory.
- Trap to cleanup temporary directory after unexpected event.

v1.2 - 20231010
- Title Name now taken from Repackinator's Title ID -> Title Name table.
- Fix regression: Now -b will always split the xiso if its size is bigger than
  FATX limit.
- New feature: no split.
  Script default to no splitting. But when -b is used, it will always split
  the xiso if its size is bigger than FATX limit.
  This no split feature is to keep the xiso unsplitted even when -b is in use.

v1.1 - 20231009
- New feature: join, to join splitted xisos.
- Now script default to no splitting, so we need to issue split (-s) if want to
  create splitted xiso (e.g. to boot it from ogxbox's disk, etc.).

v1.0 - 20230602
- Reduce print to stdout.
- Fix typos.

v0.9.1 - 20230427
- Fix: Script ignoring extract-xiso's generated image.
- dd will now skip extract-xiso's generated image as it doesn't have video
  partition.
- Fix: Script detect input with "2.iso" string in its filename as splitted xiso.
- Update README.md.

v0.9 - 20230420
- Safer script by setting -euo pipefail.
- Change deault input and output directory to user's home directory.
- Change pwd detection.
- Revert splitting to split as it's simpler than dd.
- Remove mediapatch option.
- Check if output directory is writeable by user.
- Fix: -D not removing the input
- Fix: Script failed on xiso input smaller than 4 GB.
- Fix: Hang when mounting splitted iso. Script using xbfuse to mount xiso, and
  it fail to mount second xiso so we better skip it.
- Fix: Script failed to patch attach.xbe because of different names of game's
  launcher, e.g. default.xbe, Default.xbe, DEFAULT. XBE, etc.
- Fix: Empty attach.xbe's title. When, somehow, this script failed to detect
  title from game's launcher it now will using redump's filename as the title.

v0.8  - 20230219
- Update README.
- Fix missing xxd as dependency.
- Simpler patch's offset shift.

v0.7  - 20230218
Bugs fix:
- Failed to create Icon.jpg if there are two artworks exist for an ID.
  Now it will randomly select one of thos artwork as the Icon.jpg.
- Game's certificate patched on wrong offset.
- find search for default/game.xbe recursively resulted in incorrect xiso's
  folder stucture. Now it will only search in root dir.

v0.6  - 20230216 20:41:58
- Copy default.xbe's certicate to attach.xbe. Now:
  - trainers work
  - folder and file name taken from game's title
- To copy certificate, we need to acces default/game.xbe. Unfortunately, I'm
  not yet able to directly extract default.xbe from xiso.
  Hence a new dependency; xbfuse. xbfuse used to mount xiso so we can easy acces
  to its contents.
  TODO: extract default/game.xbe directly from xiso.
- Game cover for UnleashX dashboard using Rocky5's Xbox Artwork Installer.

v0.5  - 20230211 06:15:59
- Remove split and use dd to slice big image. Less dependency is better.
- Fix: No password asked when password is not pass to the arguments.
- Lower big image threshold to 4294967296 - 1024 just to be safe not hitting
  FATX's maximum file size.

v0.4  - 20221211 13:10:34
- Revert attach.xbe to driveimageutils's version.
  Some images failed to boot from Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Add archive (7z, and its supported archives) support.
  Most of the redump images distributed in zip or 7z archives.
- Update README.md.
- Move media patching option from -p to -m.
  To make it similar to extract-xiso's option.

v0.3  - 20221018 21:45:28
- Add dd extraction method.
  dd produce bigger image as it's only remove (the small) video partition, but
  still a nice option to have in case extract-xiso method failed to create
  working image.
- Replace driveimageutils's attach.xbe with Repackinator's attach.xbe.
- Adding documentations.

v0.2  - 20220907 01:07:09
Probably a better script.

v0.1  - 20220903 19:39:50
- Initial commit.
- Basic operations such as extracting and xiso boot mostly works.
